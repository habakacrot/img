    One of the really amazing benefits has got to be the social impact that cryptocurrency and wider blockchain technology
    are already starting to have. There are plenty of people in the world who don't have access to the banking system
    that we take for granted. We tend to focus on our first world problems, and forget that cryptocurrency and blockchain
    have the potential to change lives, stimulate economies, and make the world a better place for everyone.
    Cryptocurrency works fast thanks to its peer-to-peer basis. We know there's a lot of talk around 
    speed and block sizes and Lightning network and off chain transactions, but any grumbling is a problem of perception.
    If you make transactions through your bank, even using an apparently ‘instant’ method 
    like a contactless card or making a transfer online, it can typically take three days to process the payment.
    Because there's no intermediary in cryptocurrency, wallet to wallet transactions are immediate 
    even if it feels as if they're taking a bit longer. 
    Getting rid of the intermediary also benefits people in developing economies because they
    don't have to rely on potentially corrupt central
